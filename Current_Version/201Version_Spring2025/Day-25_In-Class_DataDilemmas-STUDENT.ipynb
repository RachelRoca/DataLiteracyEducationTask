    "Today's assignment should have made you more aware about the power and the real-life harm that algorithm can cause. While they can provide great benefits like being cost-effective and speeding up time-consuming processes, they can also perpetuate harm existent in our world. Some more takeaways:\n",
    "- Pros: \n",
    "  * Algorithms can help reduce workload and synthesize large amounts of data. \n",
    "  * When implemented appropriately and thoughtfully, algorithms may help uncover patterns in candidates. \n",
    "- Cons: \n",
    "  * Algorithms reflect the data they are given. Bias in the data implies there is bias in the model. \n",
    "  * As we learned earlier in the class, all data contains bias!\n",
    "  * Bias goes beyond gender, as we talked about in this case. It can also portray ageism, ableism, racism, socioeconomic status, etc. Similarly, algorithms can favor key words in resumes that might not be present in resumes of candidates that are highly qualified.\n",
    "  * Not using data that explicitly contains race, sex, or other identities does not mean that our algorithms will not negatively impact certain groups. These groups tend to be the most marginalized and underrepresented.\n",
