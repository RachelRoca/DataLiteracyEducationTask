    "The simulation you are going to interact with today, \"Survival of the Best Fit,\" was developed by Gabor Csapo, Jihyun Kim, Miha Klasinc, and Alia ElKattan. Their intention was to create an accessible tool to educate individuals on the impact of ML and AI tools in our everyday lives. As we've learned during this semester and continue to discover, machine learning models can perpetuate human biases and inequities.  \n"

    "1. Reflection: intent vs impact:\n",
    "   1. Why was an algorithm implemented in the first place to assist in hiring new individuals? What was the intention of using machine learning? Was the intention malicious?\n",
    "   2. How did you feel when you were playing the game? Reflect on how these emotions might have contributed to the decisions that were made within the simulation.\n",
    "   3. What was the impact on the candidates of using an algorithm to assist in the hiring process?\n",
    "2. What was your strategy when deciding who to hire? How did the game react to your choices?\n",
    "3. Were you surprised by the tendencies of the algorithm? Why or why not?\n",
    "4. Play through the simulation a few times. What aspects stay the same, and what changes, regardless of the choices you make?"

    "## What's actually happening in the simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, the simulation is a simplified version of the real-world hiring process. Looking back to question 4 in the part above, you might have noticed that no matter what decisions you made the outcome stays the same. This is not an accident. You'll learn more about how exactly this works in the In-Class Assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations like this are called *deterministic* simulations. A deterministic model is a model in which the result is determined by the inputs. In other words, the outcome is predictable. This is in contrast to a *stochastic* model, where the result is not determined by the inputs, because there is randomness involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we spent a lot of time earlier in the semester learning about and coding compound interest (Day 3 and 5). If we know what the interest rate is, how much money we start with, and how much we add each year, we can predict exactly how much money we will have in the future. This is a deterministic model. On the otherhand, if we wanted to determine how much money we would have in the future if we invested in the stock market, we would have to use a stochastic model, because the stock market is unpredictable and contains elements of randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "&#9989;&nbsp; Answer the following questions in the cell below:\n",
    "1. What are the decisions you made in the game? When you changed your decisions, did the outcome change?\n",
    "2. Knowing that the game is deterministic and further, doesn't entirely depend on the decisions you make, how does this change your feelings on the game? Does this affect how you think about real-world hiring processes?\n",
    "3. Let's take a step back. The designers of the game had to make a choice to make the game deterministic and it is designed purposefully as an educational tool. How does the motivation of the game as being educational link to the user's limited control on the result? What are the benefits and drawbacks of making the game deterministic?\n"
