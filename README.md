# DataLiteracyEducationTask

Data literacy task on bias in data and algorithms designed orginally for Spring 2024, MTHE 997 at MSU

Taught in CMSE 201 since Summer 2024: each folder contains material from a different semester. You'll note as we've continuously implemented changes to better support students and facilitators.

Please feel free to reach out to Rachel Roca (rocarach@msu.edu) and Emily Bolger (bolgerem@msu.edu) with any questions. We'd love to help you implement this work into your own classroom context!
