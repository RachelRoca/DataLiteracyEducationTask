# DataLiteracyEducationTask
Data literacy task on bias in data and algorithms designed orginally for Spring 2024, MTHE 997 at Michigan State University. 

Taught in CMSE 201: Introduction to Data Science and Computational Modeling since Summer 2024. The current version is in "Current_Version" directory. Versions from previous semesters are in individual folders in the "Previous_Versions" directory. Check back as we continuously implement changes to better support students and facilitators.

Please feel free to reach out to Rachel Roca (rocarach@msu.edu) and Emily Bolger (bolgerem@msu.edu) with any questions. We'd love to help you implement this work into your own classroom context as we feel it can be easily adaptable to others courses, levels, and disciplines!
