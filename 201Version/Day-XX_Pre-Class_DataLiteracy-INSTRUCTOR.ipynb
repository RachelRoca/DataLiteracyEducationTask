    "The simulation you are going to interact with today, \"Survival of the Best Fit,\" was developed by Gabor Csapo, Jihyun Kim, Miha Klasinc, and Alia ElKattan. Their intention was to create an accessible tool to educate individuals on the impact of ML and AI tools in our everyday lives. As we will discover, machine learning models can perpetuate human biases and inequities.  \n"

    "2. What was your strategy when deciding who to hire? How did the game react to your choices?\n",
    "3. Were you surprised by the tendencies of the algorithm? Why or why not?\n",
    "4. If you have time, play through the simulation a few times. What aspects stay the same, and what changes, regardless of the choices you make?"

    "\n",
    "1. Students should mention that the ML was added to speed up the hiring process. Intent was to make things faster and hire candidates similar to when hiring without the ML. Impact was that the machine learned the biases in the data and when the boss was hiring without the ML - which lead to furthing inequities. \n",
    "2. Any discussion of strategy is fine. Usually looking at candidates CVs and qualifications, maybe looking for one skill over the other. There is some deterministic components built into the game, this can limit/affect choices students are allowed to make. \n",
    "3. Any discussion is fine. Student learn that the algorithm is more likely to hire orange individuals over blue individuals, despite the average performance of both groups being the same. They learn that this decision mimics that of the original boss when they were hiring individuals before using the algorithms. Additionally, the percentage of applicants received in the orange category is also biased due to the types of individuals that typically work (or are allowed to work) in tech; it builds of other systemic inequities. \n",
    "4. There's always a orange/blue inequity as it is built in. "
