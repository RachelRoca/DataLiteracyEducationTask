    "The simulation you are going to interact with today, \"Survival of the Best Fit,\" was developed by Gabor Csapo, Jihyun Kim, Miha Klasinc, and Alia ElKattan. Their intention was to create an accessible tool to educate individuals on the impact of ML and AI tools in our everyday lives. As we've learned during this semester and continue to discover, machine learning models can perpetuate human biases and inequities.  \n"

    "   2. How did you feel when you were playing the game? Reflect on how these emotions might have contributed to the decisions that were made within the simulation.\n",
    "   3. What was the impact on the candidates of using an algorithm to assist in the hiring process?\n",
    "2. What was your strategy when deciding who to hire? How did the game react to your choices?\n",
    "3. Were you surprised by the tendencies of the algorithm? Why or why not?\n",
    "4. If you have time, play through the simulation a few times. What aspects stay the same, and what changes, regardless of the choices you make?"

    "### ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructors should lead discussion and reflection during class time around the above questions. Below are some possible answers to the questions, and context worth bringing up in discusssions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students should mention that the ML was added to speed up the hiring process. Intent was to make things faster and hire candidates similar to when hiring without the ML. Impact was that the machine learned the biases in the data and when the boss was hiring without the ML - which lead to furthing inequities. Students may note that they were feeling stressed or under pressure when playing the game, which can further be tied to impact vs. intent. The students weren't feeling `evil' or malicious, but they were feeling rushed and stressed. This can also be expanded to think about societal norms that lead to this sort of situation in the first place: hussle culture, valuing efficiency, blurring work/life boundaries, etc.\n",
    "2. Any discussion of strategy is fine. Usually looking at candidates CVs and qualifications, maybe looking for one skill over the other. There is some deterministic components built into the game, this can limit/affect choices students are allowed to make. It is worth noting that the CV qualities (skill, school prestige, work experience, ambition) are not innate qualities of the individuals, but highly dependent on the opportunities they have had in life, as well as factors like socio-economic status. Aside: traits we may consider as innate qualities (such as intelligence) have a harried and flawed history and backing.\n",
    "3. Any discussion is fine. Student learn that the algorithm is more likely to hire orange individuals over blue individuals, despite the average performance of both groups being the same. They learn that this decision mimics that of the original boss when they were hiring individuals before using the algorithms. Additionally, the percentage of applicants received in the orange category is also biased due to the types of individuals that typically work (or are allowed to work) in tech; it builds of other systemic inequities. \n",
    "4. There's always a orange/blue inequity as it is built in, regardless of the choices made in the beginning of the game. This can be an opportunity to discuss deterministic vs. non-deterministic systems, and speculating the reasons why the game was built as it was."
